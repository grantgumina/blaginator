<h2>Get a Life</h2>
<p><strong>Posted Thu, 12 Jul 2012 08:18:00</strong></p>
<p>Despite being thrown into the challenging, dynamic, and engaging academic environment that is Purdue Engineering, many times I find myself bored with it all. I'm not talking about the problems I must solve, the rigor of studying, or having to deal with managing all the stress of life.</p>
<p>Rather I'm talking about some of the people here, their attitudes and thoughts, and the general tone of the engineering departments.</p>
<p>In order to obtain a Purdue Engineering degree, you must commit yourself 100% to your studies. You must eat, breath, and sleep engineering because that's just what it takes to get through. I get that. What I don't understand, however, is why people just don't have a life.</p>
<p>So many times a random conversation with someone starts out about school work, and just never progresses beyond that point. I rarely find someone I can strike up a conversation about music, art, the latest Zizek book or essay, my favorite Hot Chip album, etc. It's unfortunate because work is always on the forefront of people's minds that I think many students here are missing much of what college has to offer.</p>
<p>The challenge then is to find the appropriate and ideal balance and relationship between academic excellence and personal growth. The only way to do this, at least as far as I can see, is to make an conscientious decision to go out and get a life.</p>
