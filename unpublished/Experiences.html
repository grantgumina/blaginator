<h2>Experiences</h2>
<p><strong>Posted Thu, 26 Jul 2012 00:25:00</strong></p>
<p>Just thinking about how so many people I know/knew from Christian high school/middle school would talk about these amazing experiences or encounters they had at a week long Christian/church camp. They talked about it like it was a drug they were on.</p>
<p>I can’t remember those experiences, well maybe aside from my 8th grade class trip or my senior year retreat. I imagine those two experiences were just like the ones my classmates had. And just like any high the side effects wear off.</p>
<p>But I’ve had experiences that haven’t worn off too. My life was changed when I joined my FIRST Robotics team(s). I learned how much fun people were when I did ETM summer camps. And I never felt more alive when selling my lawn service business to customers, arguing with peers over robot designs, or developing software. </p>
<p>Why is it that those experiences are the ones that stand out to me? Why are they the ones that I value and I see define myself? Why do they mean something while the other ones, the “spiritual&quot; ones, don’t?</p>
