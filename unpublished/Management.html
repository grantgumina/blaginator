<h2>Management</h2>
<p><strong>Posted Thu, 27 Jun 2013 00:22:00</strong></p>
<p>July will be my second sprint here at Microsoft, and things are about to get cranked up a notch (or seven). You see, in our next sprint my feature crew will be implementing what I’ve been designing and prototyping since I got here, and as the PM I’ll be the one driving/managing that process.</p>
<p>I’ve written code and design products that have shipped to customers before, but up until this point I haven’t been solely responsible for a product’s design or launch before - it’s always been a collaborative effort. I think my challenges I’ll face are going to be primarily with planning. I’ve always worked by myself or with just one other person in the past, so I didn’t have to worry too much about the day-to-day activities of the team.</p>
<p>I think I’ll set weekly goals so we don’t get lost in the sprint. I can easily see that happening, especially as an intern where one week seems to just roll right into another and it’s hard to keep track of my schedule + 2-3 others. I’ve also setup two times a week to have a “feature crew sync&quot; (each being 30 minutes long) where we can hash out any issues that have come up and make sure we’re on track to meet our weekly goal.</p>
<p>I’m honestly hoping that we’re communicating enough throughout the week that my twice a week feature crew meetings will be (relatively) unnecessary. I wish we would all stand during these meetings though. An advantage of having people stand is everyone will be (quite literally) on their toes - they’ll be alert and paying attention at all times. They won’t have a chance to respond to an email on their laptop or a chance to lean back and tune out. Instead, their focus will be on the topic at hand. Lastly, and maybe this is because I’m a Jack White fan, but I think being comfortable kills creativity and drive. Tension is always a good when building things.</p>
<p>Also, I’m going to de-emphasize the feature crew’s spec quite a bit. I think it’s silly (especially in a team transitioning to agile) to put so much initial overhead into investigation and planning without actually building or prototyping something simultaneously. Instead, I’m going to have design drive my spec(s) now and in the future.</p>
<p>For example, after getting assigned to a feature crew I’ll start (like I did for my current FC) by interviewing users and talking with them. This will correspond with my spec’s Overview/Justification/Goals sections. Next, I’ll just start creating mockups ASAP - maybe even showing them to users. I did this for my current FC, but I need to be quicker with this process. Where I failed was that I’d design entire workflows all dependent on a few assumptions that’d be blown away once my feature crew met. This process was too costly because our meetings weren’t frequent enough and I never got any initial feedback from users. In the future, I’ll be iterating (weekly or more) with the FC and perhaps a user (provided enough has changed in the UI/workflow from the previous iteration) with my mockups. I also think I’ll save creating the Design portions of the spec until much later on in the process because it’s a hassle to re-write things when my mockups can change so fast.</p>
<p>So moving forward I’m going to do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Spend minimal time planning - instead focus on building and shipping</li>
<li>Deal with issues quickly as they come up and adjust accordingly</li>
<li>Keep constant contact with my team so we can render most FC syncs obsolete</li>
<li>Let design drive my spec</li>
</ol>
