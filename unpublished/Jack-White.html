<h2>Jack White</h2>
<p><strong>Posted Sun, 21 Apr 2013 00:05:48</strong></p>
<p>I watched <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJgY9FtDLbs">this</a> amazing interview of Jack White by Conan O’Brien earlier today, and one of the things I really got out of it was how cautious Jack White is when it comes to technology. His concerns and questions brought me back to thinking about the MHacks submission <a href="http://grantgumina.com/moments/">Moments</a> that my friends and I built earlier this year.</p>
<p>I think the big challenge and the big opportunity for anyone who makes apps, and maybe the entire developer community/software industry in general is to build apps/services/products/whatever that align to a very specific and clearly defined set of values. One possible (and I think likely next logical step) is to build apps that enable and enhance users’ productivity and allow them to create things.</p>
<p>However, I think there is also a need to rethink how we consume content.  That’s where apps like moments can help us. </p>
