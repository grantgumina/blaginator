##Letter to the COMETS##
**Posted Thu, 12 Jul 2012 08:17:00**

I wrote this letter to my FRC Team, 3357 - The COMETS, after my first semester of college. I thought I'd make it public and let anyone learn something from my experiences.

Dear COMETS,

For those of you who don't know me, my name is Grant Gumina. I was a member of FRC team 904 - Creston Robotics - from my Freshman year in high school until 2010 when several members and mentors of 904 formed our own team in the Forest Hills School District, the COMETS. Here I was involved with all sorts of interesting things from editing the team's newsletter, to designing the website, to assisting in programming, and finally being the lead driver in my senior year. For those of you that do know me, ...hello and good luck with all the n00bs“. For both groups, I wanted to write you guys a letter and give you encouragement and a little bit of advice from someone who was just in your shoes only a year ago and who has definitely seen the benefits of the program.

First, some encouragement.

Rebound Rumble looks like it's going to be an amazing compeition for both FRC students and spectators like myself. I think it's going to present you with a really tough technical challenge that will require the team to push it's understanding of game strategy, rules, and design to new, exciting limits. The good news is that the COMETS have an outstanding group of mentors, honestly I think they're some of the smartest people in Grand Rapids, who have the passion and drive to guide the team to success. Along with the mentors are obviously you guys - students! If the statistics are correct, you're among the brightest in the city and should be able to have the endurance it's going to take to build the robot in six weeks.

For those of you that are new, you might be questioning why I used the word ...endorance“. You're about to find out. The FRC isn't called ...a varsity sport for the mind“ for nothing. As an individual, success in the FRC requires levels of concentration, comitment, determination, and at times self restraint that you've probably never experienced before. If you're up for the challenge, and willing to put in huge amounts of effort (more on that later), the FRC WILL be the best thing you'll do in your high school career and will mold you into a much better person than you'd be without it.

I know I've seen those benefits first hand. Due to my involvement with recruiting sponsors for 904, I developed a relationship with Atomic Object LLC a custom software development company. Through that relationship I earned a summer internship before my senior year and ended up working for a couple employees who broke off to form another company after my senior year. The skills and work ethic/habits I learned in the FRC directly contributed to my success and ability to thrive in both companies.

This year, while at Purdue's career fair I met a recruiter from Lexmark International and ended talking to him about co-op positions at the company at length. He was impressed by my resume, and as we were finishing up our conversation was about to put my resume away until I mentioned that I was on a FRC team. As soon as he did that, he pulled my resume out from his folder, wrote more things on it, and put it away. Just last week I had a phone interview with the company and a day later was offered an appartment down there as well as a full time co-op position with them.

The FRC is a great experience, and as can be as amazing as you want it to be.

Now, some advice.

1. Work hard

I alluded to this earlier, but hard work is just as important (probably more important, actually) as intelligence. After finishing my first semester at Purdue I can tell you I've seen guys who breezed through high school with 4.0's flunk out due to a lack of initiative and discipline. They were so acustomed to everything coming easy to them that they developed a sense of entitlement regarding their grades that ended up haunting them. I've also seen people like myself who are pretty sharp but had to, and chose to, work hard and apply themselves during high school be rewarded for their discipline during their first semester here at Purdue.

To all members of the team, please remember this. Remember that in robotics, you only get out of it what you've put into it. In other words, you can't withdraw what you haven't deposited. And no there aren't any credit cards on robotics either. Nice try. But seriously, if you put a lot of effort into any task on the team, when the team wins - or loses for that matter - it MEANS so much more than it does for someone who sat on the sidelines and did nothing. When I talk about FIRST now people wonder why I get so passionate and excited about it. The answer is simple, I put a lot of work into it and that work ended up making a huge impact on my life. So work hard.

2. Do SOMETHING

It was no secret on the team that I was impacient and hated inaction. I'm the type of guy who always likes to be moving and doing something. On the robotics team, as some of you are soon going to find out, certain tasks are dependent on other tasks. So when one team/task gets behind, they inevitably put all the other teams behind. This can get really annoying, but when this happens you have two choices to make. You can either sit around, do nothing, and become a distraction to those that are working. Or you can take initiative, find another task to work on (it may not be as glamorous as designing a manipulator or testing code) and do that. It's a step, albiet a small one, towards success. I remember our first year when we were terribly behind schedule, we assigned idle hands to help other teams with their projects, brainstorms strategies/scouting systems, or even pick up trash or vacuum the floor. Even though it may seem meanial or ...below you“ (entitlement issues there), it's a step towards success. Take it.

3. Listen

Not only is the COMETS a bunch of fun, and not only will it give you opportunities to teach yourself important skills, membership on the COMETS is an exclusive thing where high school students get the chance to work alongside professionals. Your mentors are some of the smartest people in the city. Many of them have been working professionally as an engineer, businessman, programmer, etc. for longer than you've been alive. They're a great resource who will not only help you build that manipulator, but also guide you as you chose a college and career. In fact, I still communicate with many of the team's mentors asking for career advice and such. They're really friendly people who can teach you a lot, so when they make a suggestion, reason with them, learn from them, hell disagree with them, but do all those things in a respectful and humble manner. They're volunteering their time, thousands of dollars worth of time, to you. That's the biggest take away you get from robotics, the hundreds of collective hours that passionate mentors pour into the team. Listen and learn from them.

I think that's all I've got right now. I can't wait to see the amazing things that you all design and build this year. It looks like you got your work cut out for you, so Boiler Up! Go COMETS! kick some ass out there!
