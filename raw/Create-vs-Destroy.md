##Create vs. Destroy##
**Posted Thu, 12 Jul 2012 08:18:00**

When you create you participate in the divine. To create means you are extending yourself and imposing your will onto your surroundings.

When you destroy you betray all that is good and wholesome. To destroy means you are imposing your will onto other's and not your surroundings.

Someone who creates works with people where they are and sees the potential in them. Someone who destroys expects and forces others to conform to how they see fit.

Someone who creates sees beauty in places least expected. Someone who destroys sees ugliness in all the obvious places.

Someone who creates chooses to live for no other man other than himself. Someone who destroys constantly seeks the approval of others.

Someone who creates speaks firmly in sweet soft whispers. Someone who destroys shouts in frantic bursts.

Someone who creates is a participant in the divine. Someone who destroys betrays the divine.
