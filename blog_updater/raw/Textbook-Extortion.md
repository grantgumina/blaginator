##Textbook Extortion##
**Posted Tue, 15 Jan 2013 00:00:07**

If you’re a college student you’re familiar with the outrageous prices of textbooks. Usually a new textbook from the university bookstore will run you around $100-$200. After a semester of opening once, maybe twice, when you try and sell it back you’ll get at most $50-$70. Talk about great returns…

Now after first semester of Freshman year, you inevitably wisen up and realize that blindly buying every textbook your overlords tell you to is for shmucks. So you get clever and (1) wait a couple weeks into the course to see if you ever need the book, (2) make lots of upper classmen friends and buy their old books, (3) bump into a pdf of the needed book on the internet and share it with all your friends (sadly it’s a rare occasion your university-customized text is ever digitized).

However, pretty soon your cleverness runs out as you encounter an equally clever adversary: the professor who, quite literally, “wrote the book". These gems of academia have found a way to legally extort debt-laden, poor, teenagers and make bank because of it. Here’s how it usually goes.

>    As you’re cleverly shopping for textbooks on Amazon or texting your friends, you’re comparing what’s online with what’s on the course’s required materials list. You notice something. The edition on the list is one edition newer than what’s on Amazon. Oh and wait… one more thing… huh? It can’t be! Bastard! The professor authored this $175 monstrosity!

>    Calmly you recover. “Don’t panic", you tell yourself. You reassure yourself everything will be fine and you’ll be able to get away with spending $60 on a used older edition. You hold off ordering anything until the first day of class.

>    On the first day of class, the clever professor shatters any illusions of calmness and tranquility. He says that you’ll need to buy the latest edition of the textbook (failing to mention he’s the guy who wrote it) and that all of your homework will come from it. If he’s a real bastard, he might even mention that chances of failing the class increase dramatically without the textbook as there’s special material in the latest edition that will be on your exams.

I’m sure you’ve had experiences similar, maybe even identical, to this story. It’s extortion pure and simple. It’s the kind of problem that ideally could be fixed with a radical culture change within academia brought about by realizations of the existential threats presented by online education. However, the reality is it’s a problem that practically will be fixed by disruptive technologies and rebellious students. More on that later.
