Tuh-chup. Tuh-chup. Tuh-chup. Thwack. Newline.

Over and over again.

Open terminal. VIM. Save. Run.

Boom. Mess. Errors left and right.

Tuh-chup. Tuh-chup. Tuh-chup. Thwack. Newline.

Over and over again.

Just you and the system.

Is it a compulsion?

An addiction?

You can’t help it.

You can’t shut your brain off. 

The ideas won’t stop.

The creative can’t stop.

Creating and producing comes natural.

He’s beside himself when there’s nothing.

His code is his art.

Creating something out of nothing.

Out of nothingness comes order.

Logic.

A plan.

So it goes.

Over and over again.
