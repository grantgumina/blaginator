##Intimidation##
**Posted Thu, 12 Jul 2012 08:19:58**

I think the best learning environments are ones that make you have a small hint of intimidation in the back of your mind. When you are a little intimidated by your peers, mentors, or work itself you push yourself harder and achieve more than you might have thought possible. So if you're not intimidated by your work, school, or whatever ask yourself why not and what you can do to change that.
