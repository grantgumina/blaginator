##Tension##

People have always told me to be content. As a kid I was super ADD. Like nuts-o. I was always building things, destroying things, and building them back together (usually with Legos. After I build a Lego kit I would play with it for 15 minutes and then destroy it and see what else I could do. I also never rebuilt the kit as I had ...been there done that“). I never could really stay on one task or activity for too long. I always had to be moving. For those that know me, not much has really changed.

Recently I've been thinking about that idea of contentment and what it means in the various contexts I've heard it talked about.

Maybe you need to be content with yourself. But is it a good thing to be content with a dull relationship or ...ho-hum“ job? Is it a bad thing to want more when relatively your problems might not be all that serious?

This is the tension I think so many people in 1st world countries deal with today. It's a feeling of restlessness and discomfort in the middle of what for most people on the planet would be a paradise. When I would complain to my parents about not having something that a friend had they would say ...count your blessings“. That's great advice to an eight year old, but what happens with twenty year olds are told that?

Isn't that kind of thinking just a little bit dangerous? If we all thought that way nothing would ever get done. What would have happened if Edison had been content with candles or Bell with telegrams?

Since I can't really describe the tension, maybe I can frame it with a question. How do you constantly strive to be the best you can be without losing yourself in the process?
