##Experiences##

Just thinking about how so many people I know/knew from Christian high school/middle school would talk about these amazing experiences or encounters they had at a week long Christian/church camp. They talked about it like it was a drug they were on.

I can’t remember those experiences, well maybe aside from my 8th grade class trip or my senior year retreat. I imagine those two experiences were just like the ones my classmates had. And just like any high the side effects wear off.

But I’ve had experiences that haven’t worn off too. My life was changed when I joined my FIRST Robotics team(s). I learned how much fun people were when I did ETM summer camps. And I never felt more alive when selling my lawn service business to customers, arguing with peers over robot designs, or developing software. 

Why is it that those experiences are the ones that stand out to me? Why are they the ones that I value and I see define myself? Why do they mean something while the other ones, the “spiritual" ones, don’t?
