Change is inevitable. You're going to change in some way, shape, or form throughout your life. It can be physical change. Personality change. A change in tastes or preferences. Even a change of opinion. Life is not static.

What's interesting though is how many people don't realize they've changed and still try to achieve the goals they set before them when they were different. Then, hopefully, at some point they realize they're not happy. However, instead of exploring their unhappiness and discomfort, something that requires a lot of courage, they push themselves further and faster down the path that will not satisfy them anymore. I think too many people live their lives this way and ultimately live miserable and unfulfilled lives.

I've found out that if you open yourself up to the uneasy feeling of questioning yourself, meditating and reflecting on your feelings, and then embracing what you find you'll ultimately be happier and more focused on things that really matter.
