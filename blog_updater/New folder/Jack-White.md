##Jack White##

I watched [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJgY9FtDLbs) amazing interview of Jack White by Conan O’Brien earlier today, and one of the things I really got out of it was how cautious Jack White is when it comes to technology. His concerns and questions brought me back to thinking about the MHacks submission [Moments](http://grantgumina.com/moments/) that my friends and I built earlier this year.

I think the big challenge and the big opportunity for anyone who makes apps, and maybe the entire developer community/software industry in general is to build apps/services/products/whatever that align to a very specific and clearly defined set of values. One possible (and I think likely next logical step) is to build apps that enable and enhance users’ productivity and allow them to create things.

However, I think there is also a need to rethink how we consume content.  That’s where apps like moments can help us.
