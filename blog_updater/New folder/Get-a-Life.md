##Get a Life##
**Posted Thu, 12 Jul 2012 08:18:00**

Despite being thrown into the challenging, dynamic, and engaging academic environment that is Purdue Engineering, many times I find myself bored with it all. I'm not talking about the problems I must solve, the rigor of studying, or having to deal with managing all the stress of life.

Rather I'm talking about some of the people here, their attitudes and thoughts, and the general tone of the engineering departments.

In order to obtain a Purdue Engineering degree, you must commit yourself 100% to your studies. You must eat, breath, and sleep engineering because that's just what it takes to get through. I get that. What I don't understand, however, is why people just don't have a life.

So many times a random conversation with someone starts out about school work, and just never progresses beyond that point. I rarely find someone I can strike up a conversation about music, art, the latest Zizek book or essay, my favorite Hot Chip album, etc. It's unfortunate because work is always on the forefront of people's minds that I think many students here are missing much of what college has to offer.

The challenge then is to find the appropriate and ideal balance and relationship between academic excellence and personal growth. The only way to do this, at least as far as I can see, is to make an conscientious decision to go out and get a life.
