##Figure out what you don't want to do##

So I spent the day attending a corporate “networking" event. If I hear that word one more time I’m going to scream. So much of the event was about “figuring out what you want", or “finding your calling", or my favorite “find something you like to do". I’m so sick of all these cheesy, positive, and phony phrases it’s nuts. When you focus on what you want to do, I think you end up compromising on your goals and visions. Let me explain.

It’s pretty simple. You can always find something you like. Even in terrible situations where you don’t enjoy what you do, where you come into work looking forward to leaving, or when you have another opportunity else where, you can find something in what you’re currently doing that you like.

Point is I think when people tell you to find something you like within a company and do it, I think it could be an attempt to control you and put you in a box. Sometimes you need to move on to the next thing. Sometimes one thing must end in order for something better to happen. And sometimes it’s simply more difficult to find out what we like. Sometimes we just don’t know.

Instead, I think we need to find what we don’t like. Let’s focus on the negatives and fix them. Let’s find out what we don’t like and make a decision on what to do about it. Hopefully by acting upon what we don’t like we can propel ourselves closer to what we’re supposed to be doing, even if that’s ambiguous.
