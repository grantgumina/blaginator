<h2>Tension</h2>
<p><strong>Posted Thu, 12 Jul 2012 08:20:00</strong></p>
<p>People have always told me to be content. As a kid I was super ADD. Like nuts-o. I was always building things, destroying things, and building them back together (usually with Legos. After I build a Lego kit I would play with it for 15 minutes and then destroy it and see what else I could do. I also never rebuilt the kit as I had ...been there done that“). I never could really stay on one task or activity for too long. I always had to be moving. For those that know me, not much has really changed.</p>
<p>Recently I've been thinking about that idea of contentment and what it means in the various contexts I've heard it talked about.</p>
<p>Maybe you need to be content with yourself. But is it a good thing to be content with a dull relationship or ...ho-hum“ job? Is it a bad thing to want more when relatively your problems might not be all that serious?</p>
<p>This is the tension I think so many people in 1st world countries deal with today. It's a feeling of restlessness and discomfort in the middle of what for most people on the planet would be a paradise. When I would complain to my parents about not having something that a friend had they would say ...count your blessings“. That's great advice to an eight year old, but what happens with twenty year olds are told that?</p>
<p>Isn't that kind of thinking just a little bit dangerous? If we all thought that way nothing would ever get done. What would have happened if Edison had been content with candles or Bell with telegrams?</p>
<p>Since I can't really describe the tension, maybe I can frame it with a question. How do you constantly strive to be the best you can be without losing yourself in the process?</p>
