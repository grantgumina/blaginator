<h2>Mission Accomplished</h2>
<p><strong>Posted Thu, 12 Jul 2012 08:19:00</strong></p>
<p>Near the end of my senior year of high school, my friend Wilson showed methese two articles (first from Harvard Business Review the second from The Acton Institute) about defining and obtaining what you believe to be successful.</p>
<p>By reading these two articles, I understood more than ever before that each and every decision I make is permanent and can either get me closer or farther away from reaching my goals. As I entered Purdue University this past August I kept this in mind and took steps to ensure I wasn't wasting my time.</p>
<p>Before I came to Purdue, I wrote down a list of goals that I wanted to accomplish by the time I finished my freshman year. They were:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make great friends, create great experiences</li>
<li>Be more social than ever before</li>
<li>Workout/lose weight</li>
<li>Excel in school work</li>
<li>Earn an internship</li>
<li>Enter Sophomore year with above a 3.0 GPA</li>
</ol>
<p>Each one of those goals has been accomplished. Since coming here, I've grown both intellectually and socially. I've made some terrific friends and met more interesting people than ever before. I've learned that in order to not go insane you must chose to be an optimist and see potential and beauty in everyone and everything. Otherwise you find yourself complaining about a lack of interesting people. The reality is that just about everyone is interesting, you just need to figure out how and in what ways.</p>
<p>I took working out seriously this year as well by continuing to workout daily (something I started doing after senior year) throughout the year. To date, I've lost about 60 lbs from this time last year.</p>
<p>Starting in a couple weeks I'll be interning with Lexmark International on their firmware team in Lexington, KY. I've met some of my co-workers via a Lexmark Facebook group, and I can't wait for the struggle and reward of challenging work.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, school's done too! Just finished my last exam (CS159). Grades aren't in yet, but assuming I haven't made an erroneous calculation I'll definitely be getting above a 3.0 this school year. Boiler Up!</p>
<p>I guess all I can say now is, ...mission accomplishedâ€œ.</p>
