<h2>Create vs. Destroy</h2>
<p><strong>Posted Thu, 12 Jul 2012 08:18:00</strong></p>
<p>When you create you participate in the divine. To create means you are extending yourself and imposing your will onto your surroundings.</p>
<p>When you destroy you betray all that is good and wholesome. To destroy means you are imposing your will onto other's and not your surroundings.</p>
<p>Someone who creates works with people where they are and sees the potential in them. Someone who destroys expects and forces others to conform to how they see fit.</p>
<p>Someone who creates sees beauty in places least expected. Someone who destroys sees ugliness in all the obvious places.</p>
<p>Someone who creates chooses to live for no other man other than himself. Someone who destroys constantly seeks the approval of others.</p>
<p>Someone who creates speaks firmly in sweet soft whispers. Someone who destroys shouts in frantic bursts.</p>
<p>Someone who creates is a participant in the divine. Someone who destroys betrays the divine.</p>
